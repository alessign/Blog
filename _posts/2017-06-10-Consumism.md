Who wants to bring children to this "Consumism"? Our purpose became to compete how much and what brand we can consume in lifetime. That's our value. We are wasting our entire lives to this. Just look at yourself from higher perspective. When did you stop being truly happy and free?

When you're a child, you enjoy the life as it is, because you have freedom. Yes, there are some rules, but you're still free and you're learning through exploring and experiencing things. When we ship out to work, all disappears. The system somebody created takes over. You become slave driven by rewards of consumism, but you don't see yourself through so many labels. It's almost like when you're a child, the system will not touch you , because you're underage and it'll be immora, but when you hit the legal age, you're in it in full swing. Your frequency changes from joy to survival. It will be really interesting to live one year without marketing. No brands, no labels. Funny enough, all futuristic movies have that, have you noticed? There's no signs on buildings, no advertising on doors, windows, streets, clothing, transportation objects....it's all clean. It's peaceful.

If you have brands, the pressure is on. What you like versus what your surrounding is able to accept, what's in fashion, etc. We don't see it that way, but we are creating the sufferings in our own heads. It doesn't exist outside that scull. If you would be last two people on Earth and have an argument about which car or clothing is better, if you both suddenly drop dead, there will be no suffering. The suffering never existed. Why are we spending our lives creating attachments to labels instead of truly living our lives? What is so better about it? What more satisfaction it delivers? It's a value we gave it, a label, in its true existence it doesn't have it. If you take closer look on any object under the microscope, these structures don't have labels. These tiny atoms don't have strings with brand on it. Duality.

Your consciousness was taken away from you by making false beliefs, creating attachments to them. How do you know it's false? Well, if you buy an object, be it a clothing or car, if it truly would satisfy your needs, you wouldn't desire new the next day. It is temporary satisfaction of a feeling. Which feeling? You want to treat yourself. It's making your belief stronger, that you deserve things, that you're good person or mostly, that you want to feel good, because your life sucks at certain period. Have you noticed that impulse if something is going wrong in your life, you need to treat yourself? Get an ice cream, buy new shoes, new dress...but you wake up in the morning and have the same feeling again. You can go and buy another shoes or dress. It's not that you need it, you bought new items just yesterday, but it's because you created coping mechanism. Instead of dealing with the underlying issue, you replace it with short temporary solution which feels good. But it's not solution at all. If it would be, the problem in question would disappear with that purchase. It never does. It actually creates more problems. Consumism.

Because of your demand, there's more resources wasted for something what is not needed. It's not the one pair of shoes you bought, it's the whole chain reaction. Marketing studies, what consumers trending, this delivers new, cheaper brands with similar look/purpose, so the battle customer can begin. Consumism. Next time you're in a shop, have a look at the shelves. Do we really need all that crap? For what? We have selections of everything in thousands variations. What a waste of Earths resources and how much we're wasting. Waste it's a proof we don't need things or can't consume them all. But there is a hope. Spirituality is spreading fast and people are awakening. World will be great place again when we will stop creating attachments to labels and exhausting our resources only to temporarily treat our sufferings.
