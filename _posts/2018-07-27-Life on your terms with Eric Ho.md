>Law of attraction, vibrations, spirituality, akasha...yoga, well being, healthy food...business and/or work..we all are facing the same challenge. There's so much information out there and when we start absorbing it, we just don't know how much of it do we need, when to use it and how to practise. We can easily get overwhelmed by all that information and confuse ourselves so much, that nothing actually works. We need a coach!

**Accelerating Abundance with [Eric Ho](http://www.erichoofficial.com)**

Probably as many other awakened people, the journey towards transformation and turning my life around, I am experiencing a bumpy road.

After realising what life really is, how valuable it is and what it means to me, I am refusing to work as a slave who is rewarded with 3 weeks of holiday per year. I was born free, when did it change? My life has nothing to do with my life - if you know what I mean by that. There are so many aspects on different levels we don’t control and the so called reality we create in our conscious  minds is only reflection of how we understand and picture things. Life will happen even without our conscious mind, when you’re at sleep or in a coma.

In a past few years I have been working on my personal transformation and my startup businesses, but having a startup is really challenging. The good thing is, these situations are pushing me to use my skills, gifts and talents so I can get myself out of the danger. Not so long time ago I was stretched to my limits financially and so I started to work on myself again to heal my fears, discover and remove my blocks obstructing the flow of the abundance into my life. From [Eric’s YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/EricHoOfficial) channel I’ve learned to understand my fears better and to step out of my comfort zone. I also came across his book - **“Set it and forget it”** - which I completed in one go and it is nicely summarising the universal laws and how they work, so you can take the advantage of them.

One night before the bed time, I did my breathing exercise to tune in and I started to meditate to connect with my spiritual guides. I was asking for guidance and for assistance with my financial situation. Then I applied what I’ve learned from the Eric’s book, knowing now that the energy created by my thoughts and feelings never disappear. I’ve been practising various methods for manifesting my desires into my reality, but Eric said one thing which made everything more clear. “The universe isn’t responding to what we want or don’t want, it responds to your thoughts and emotions!” That alone makes me now focus on my feelings in the “NOW” moment.

The next day after the meditation, as a subscriber to [Eric’s YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/EricHoOfficial) channel, I received promotional email from him with an opportunity to attend webinar focusing on online marketing. I usually  do not open  these kind of emails, but this time I thought - just last night I asked for guidance and I probably shouldn’t ignore this message. So I booked my space. I didn’t know what to expect, but I thought - hey, free lesson on marketing can help me with my startup business perhaps. How wrong I was! Something even better was ahead!

The whole webinar was about how to set up passive income online in relatively easy way, so you can achieve financial freedom using this shortcut. It was a strategy I never thought of and I was amazed. At the end of the webinar Eric offered heavily discounted tickets to his programme about this strategy in complete way, so the first 30 lucky people will have the chance to see the system working in great detail and will have the opportunity to work with Eric directly. Although I reacted fast enough to sign up, the problem was that I didn’t have the money to pay for it. My bank account is empty and I have outstanding bills on top of my loans. Eric offered to all of us financial planning to split the payments in three months. Very kind gesture. Still, zero on my account and where do I get £300 within next 2 minutes?

First I was a bit sad that I missed my opportunity and couldn’t figure out how to pay for the ticket within 5 minutes, but as soon as I processed my feelings, I realised it was actually amazing opportunity to learn something new and that perhaps I am skilled enough to make it work on my own. I can build website, I can produce designs…I can make this work! My determination was strong after Eric’s energy exchange, so I started to do more research about the strategy itself and what would it take to start. I am still on it and collecting necessary information. I will succeed! I feel something.

 A few days later, a member from Eric’s team contacted me regarding the payment plan options for the sponsored ticket and if I want to proceed. I explained my situation and that I will make this to work regardless. The webinar was really eye opening for me and I had sense  of direction after that. Amazing Olivia offered a ticket for the next event in London instead. I was thrilled and happily accepted the offer.

The **H Akademy** weekend event with Eric and his team connected the dots for me and I realised I have to do immediate changes and take actions. First, in order to keep my energy vibrations on the level of my desires, I need to change my environment and people I meet - matching the same or higher vibration to my desires/goals. Second, be bold, put my existing business on the side for the time being to figure out later and focus on passive income and money management system. Once I have the money I can support my business with whatever it needs. We all left the event with so many new tools to work with and charged with new energy. Destination SUCCESS!

My recommendation to anyone is to [follow](https://www.youtube.com/user/EricHoOfficial) and engage with Eric’s events at any opportunity which clicks with you. Even if you’re new to the spirituality or business. There is a reason why you’re reading this blog and why will Eric cross your life. He and his team are very supportive and you never know what will enfold in front of you. Let it flow, don’t resist it.

Eric - thank you sir….
