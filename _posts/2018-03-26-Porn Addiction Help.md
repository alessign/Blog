>Let’s get to it without big intro on how damaging it may be or how damaging it is to you. Chances are, if you found this article, you need help or know someone who does. I am not here to judge you.

Everybody has different way of dealing with addictions and this approach worked for me and few people I shared my method with. I wanted to help more people, so I decided to describe it below. What’s the strategy? Let’s break it down into four steps.

1. **What is porn?**
You need to begin to see the full picture, not just targeted information, which was passed on to you through your browser. You’ve been absorbing only the “final product”, which is about 15% of the whole scope.

2. **How do you develop addiction?**
Analyse and understand how did you get there, so you can do reverse engineering.

3. **What is sexuality?**
Develop new understanding about your sexual potential as conscious human being and how much you’re missing out.

4. **How to move on?**
What do you resist, persists. Use all the points above to identify root cause, to identify real urge feeling and to identify triggers to create a strategy, which will help you to stop your addiction by converting it to a new understanding and use it as leverage to move on.


### What is porn VS what is porn for you  
In order to start, we need to dig inside our subconscious mind and find out what we have porn associated with until now. Everybody will have different results, but in general, the purpose is to expose everything associated with this industry, so we can see the full picture. Until now, you are struggling to stop, because you have associated porn with pleasure only and it’s not easy to give it up and because there’s not enough negative information about porn for your subconscious mind to work with, you’re trapped. Your mind is focusing on the final product only and ignoring the rest. It’s like taking a ride in super luxury and comfy car, but your mind is refusing to see that it is leaking oil, smoking and polluting environment heavily and you’re ignoring everyone else by not offering lift, so they have to walk for miles. You love your isolated box from inside, but you are not aware what it does on the outside. Let’s put it on scales. Ratio good to bad. If you want this to work, you need to be brutally honest with yourself and forget about your ego and what everyone is saying or endorsing you to watch something. It’s a process and sometimes you may feel that in order to be accepted by your friends, you need to be doing what they are. Well, maybe that’s the problem right here, these people might keep you where you are and if so, time to re-think.

Let’s not focus on the pleasure aspects for our scales, but dive directly to negative ones. After all we want to stop addiction, not encourage it. Let’s create list of items you can think about of what is going on in the porn industry. I will list few items so you can see where am I heading, but you need to do this work yourself. It’s important to engage your mind, think, generate feelings, associate them and all that helps not to forget about it. *Write it all down, you will work with it later.

* Porn is multi-billion dollar industry with quick cash for those who are willing, but even unwilling get public

* It’s focused on male supremacy and women needs to be constantly proving how much they can disgrace themselves so they can be accepted

* Because it is online, the models are treated by algorithms. If after new upload she had good response in number of views, she will be offered another job. Those who have little response from viewers, the model in some cases doesn’t even get paid, her live is ruined because she exposed herself to public and will not be offered another job anytime soon. Because she risked all already, she needs to come back next time with more daring scenes, so she can be accepted. She would not be doing these sexual practices in private. Viewers and algorithms are ruining hundreds of lives daily.

* Porn is staged and mostly faked. As you will learn later, women do not behave the way you see in hardcore porn movies

* This is someone’s daughter/son. How would I feel if millions of people would watch my daughter/son the same way I am watching these actors in porn now?

* There’s no smell, touch and even sound to amplify your sexual arousal. Sound is present in videos, but there’s difference if your partner whisper moan to your ear...it belong only to you, not another million people. It has different magnitude.

* Porn is a concept, it isn’t real. If it would, everybody would be living very happy lives. Not like today - millions of people are suffering the consequences of porn addictions.

* Porn is only separated aspect of your real sexuality. It’s only extension

* It’s hypnotic and makes lose the track of the time

* It’s in 2D, where’s the real experience in 3D will all senses engaged, not just eyes

* It’s someone else’s reality, not yours

* Porn is making you lose the ability to be sexual and to express your sexuality. It strips away your true identity and you are distancing further away from yourself.

This isn’t complete list. When you write your own, you will see that if you’re serious about the change, your mind will be producing more and more negative facts about the porn and the industry. That’s a progress. When your mind will offer another item tomorrow, come back to your list and add it there. It’s a process, keep reviewing it.

**Porn versus masturbation** - Many people take it as one thing. We need to separate these two terms. Masturbation is act or reaction to something on conscious/subconscious mind and porn is just tool to achieve something. You could replace it with only imagination or real person. The real question is, why do you have the need to masturbate? Is it because you want to treat yourself, or because you want to deplete your energy to avoid something?

**How would depleting your energy serve you?** (hidden benefits)
* to loose interest in someone - avoiding contact
* to avoid responsibility
* to make yourself relax from stress

**How do you develop addiction?**  
Chemicals in our brain like dopamine causes you to want more each time and over time, your addiction goes to extremes, which makes your arousal much harder in real life. For major chemicals work together to create pleasant experience and strong bond with the partner. If kissing or touching will be associated with triggering the raise of your arousal, that’s how it will be intensified in the future. If you develop this bond with porn instead, your arousal will depend on images/videos and because you don’t engage 100% of all your senses, you need to compensate with more “weird” stuff. The porn videos which aroused you when you first started watching porn will not move with you today. The imagery is necessary now to climax. In this case you’re not with your partner and your mind is only responding to fantasy. If your partner watches porn also, you both are with your separate fantasies and your “sex” is more like mutual masturbation. People seize to be people. Because you objectify other people on the screen, you will inevitably experience drop in self esteem.

We become addicted when we separate only the pleasure aspect from the whole picture. It is then fuelled by the convenience of being alone, no need to satisfy the partner or simply time investment.

That’s not everything, it is mostly connected to a deeper issue. Subconscious belief which you’re not fully aware of just yet. That’s why you keep doing it, it’s a coping mechanism to escape something. We will dive deeper in step 4

Are you afraid of real connection? Porn allows you someone else without attachments, expectations, responsibilities and under your conditions...what are you afraid of in your life?

**What is sexuality?**  
Intimacy with someone allows us to be vulnerable and to allow someone to experience it. We let the chosen people see into ourselves. That’s what creates bonds and fuels love. Intimacy allows you to explore and to know yourself, develop and expand yourself as a person. Sexuality derives from creative energy. The sexual organs stores the most vibrant energy in the whole body and it is used for creation of life. If you deplete it for no reason or because you want to treat yourself, you didn’t gain anything creative out of the process, or nothing was created. If you’re a man, in order to orgasm and to ejaculate, the surrounding organs in your body have to give up their energy to feed the process. That’s why you feel so tired immediately after climax. You experience “orgasm hangover”. As you know, it’ll take considerable time to recover to be ready for another round. Not talking about the other organs which lost their energy and cannot function properly. Taoists are teaching how to manage the process properly to your benefit in “Sexual Kung-fu” (Kung-fu = practice). Because modern medicine can measure the climax process, it is confirmed that orgasm happens first and acts as a trigger for ejaculation. Tao knew that long, long time ago already and were teaching how you can separate orgasm from ejaculation not to lose your energy. It is totally possible to orgasm without ejaculation and because you didn’t lose your energy, you can continue with another round. By practicing TAO teachings, you will become multi-orgasmic man, not only that, your orgasms will be felt and amplified by the whole body and the “regular “ orgasm you are able to achieve now, will feel way smaller. Hardly worth the effort. Similar approaches can be learned from the true tantric sex, which comes from Buddhism. I don’t mean the “western tantra” which has some pictures of various positions and guide how to have relaxed sex. True tantra focuses on four noble truths and practices with mantras, meditations and much more.

**How to move on**  
We are creating our reality based what we pay attention to and where our focus is. You need to be completely aware what are you escaping from by watching porn and what is the “secondary gain” of it. Secondary gain means, that by doing particular habit in conscious mind for some obvious reason, it also has another hidden benefits for your subconscious mind you’re not aware of consciously. In another words, you think you’re doing something or behave certain way because the situation was requesting it, but what you don’t see that this is just trigger mechanism to satisfy the secondary gain. In case of a person who struggles with porn addiction, the example could be:
He has impulse to watch porn each time after work. He may think it’s because he’s horny, or because there’s new content waiting, but the truth is, he is doing because the work he’s at is not inspiring him, it’s stressful and he doesn’t enjoy being there. Because it is violating his boundaries every day, he developed coping mechanism associated with pleasure as a form of treating himself - watching porn. Every person will find different secondary gains for watching porn, but when you do, you’re on the right track!

First, we need to identify the root. This is journey inwards and again, it requires brutal honesty and no ego. There are several questions you can ask yourself and answer them truly.

* Is porn adding something to my life, or is it taking something away?
* What is the secondary gain to feel disconnected from real people?
* What is so better about porn, than real people? Why do I prefer simulation before real act?
* Why do I prefer someone else’s reality before my own?
* How do I benefit from being disconnected?
* What do I gain by loosing my energy?
* Where in my life am I blocked with creation? Is it connected? Who made feel that way? What is the secondary gain of this?
* What makes me deplete my energy? Who made feel that way? What is the secondary gain of this?
* Is there responsibility in my life I am not ready for? Why am I avoiding responsibility?
* Who made feel this way?
* What experience/trauma happened in my life, which caused the development of this coping mechanism?
* When was I most happy in my life before my porn addiction? What was happening in my life before that? What is different now?

These were just example questions how to identify the root cause, but you need to come up with more questions by yourself. You are the one who needs to do the inner work. Next time you feel like to watch porn, sit with the feeling - don’t go and watch, but analyse it this time. Go towards the feeling, don’t judge it. Just be with it. Let it tell you what it needs. Maybe it is just an old feeling which wants to be accepted and integrated. What you resist - persists. Go towards it and become the feeling itself to find what it is, what makes you escape something by watching porn. When you focus enough and have a clarity in your mind, you will be able to see the root cause.
Once you have it, it’s time for next step:

**Identify triggers**  
The feeling of watching porn is always triggered by something. You cannot identity what it is, unless you’re aware about the root cause. It’s a same process as with finding the root cause. Just sit down with the feeling and think what happened in your life in past few minutes, hours, perhaps the whole day. The timing will be relative to your situation - is it morning/afternoon/evening now? Try to think of events, which happened just before you wanted to watch porn and which might be related to the root cause.

* Did someone made you unhappy/stressed?
* What situation have triggered your insecurity alarm bells?
* Have you been expected to show some sort of responsibility?
* Are you dealing with stress which needs release?
* Is there a pattern in situations happening before you have the need to watch the porn? Can you identify any triggers?


Once you’re aware of your triggers, you can start to deal with the root cause. Trigger is not activated immediately, but after short while when the original feeling is ignored. Now we need to change your focus. If you know what the root cause is and what the trigger is, it shouldn’t be hard to move on and that addiction. Next time the trigger fires, you will recognise it and the list of all negative things about the porn industry comes handy - read it. It will help you shift the focus. You will find, that you no longer feel to watch, because you’ve been honest with yourself, processed your feelings and stop yourself from falling the same trap to escape it.

This is good enough to make you stop watching porn, but now there’s something missing, isn’t it?
Something was removed and we need to fill the void. Give yourself new meaning around your sexuality. Allow yourself to be a student again and learn something new each time instead of watching porn. Or use the creative sexual energy to express your creativity.

**Practice daily**  
Find the time to read all negative things about porn every day. Study shows, that our mind needs about a month to rewire and reprogram itself with new information. You will see, that the more you read about it and think about the negatives, the more reasons you will start to discover and soon new understanding about porn will be formed. You’ll reset and after about a month you will start to feel the need for human connection again. Real human connection.

This is your greatest chance to understand yourself and if you read TAO books about sexuality, your progress will be faster. Most beneficial is to read these books about both genres - male & female sexual Kung-fu, so you can understand the connections between you and your partner. You will understand the key energy exchanges and circulation is in your body and how you can use both male and female energies to merge into one, when making love. Sexual kung fu is becoming more and more popular and it’s not hard to achieve progress. TAO sexual Kung-fu is not about God and religion, it’s about how to harvest and use your creative energy correctly.

Do you want your creative energy to be constantly depleted, or do you want to use it towards your daily creations and artistic expressions? The choice is yours – so if you understand the mechanism behind it. You can give your existence new meaning, dive into understanding your and your partner’s sexual energy to become multi orgasmic with the ability to keep your energy at the same time.

Depleting sexual energy was proven to have negative impact on athletes performance. They are not allowed to have sex or masturbate before the match/game.

Why the greatest artists, scientists, etc, are mostly loners or introverts? Got it?

Take your life into your hands and become an artist in your original way! Your reality is waiting for you out there, don’t focus on someone else’s projection of the past. Porn is not a live event!

* _Writing is important part of the disconnecting process. If you read something short, you may remember all, or at least majority of the information. But if you read 50 pages of text, you will remember very little. The same is if you hear any information - if it’s short, you’ll remember the whole message, but if it’s a long talk, you find difficult to remember everything. If it’s important for you, you will naturally make notes to create reference points, so you can recreate the whole context later. By writing things down you allow your mind to wander deeper and absorb more information, or to be open to more information. You are extending the capacity of your brain by making reference points on paper, so you can remind yourself to context quickly. We are writing things down your brain is focusing on the information received, so it prevents to forget the backdrop is, that the brain is not Open to new information which leads to a larger scope, so it doesn’t forget it_.
